  skillDescription: This attack will drive the character forward 3 tiles, performing
    a standard rapier attack against every opponent within those tiles. every opponent
    within those tiles will be given a chance for bleed for 1d4 turns. Bleed deals
    1d3 damage, bypassing armor, unless treated by a healing item or ability. This
    attack will push enemies back in a straight line up to the distance of the attack's
    range. If the position an enemy would be pushed into is unwalkable, the enemy
    is stopped one space short of the unwalkable tile, this character will be stopped
    one tile short of that enemy.
